# characterization-2types-olive-endocarp

GUI with Matlab to train a neural network for classification between 2 types of olive's endocarp, which are "Gordal de Ja√©n" and "Nevadillo de Alhambra". The classifier is included too.

Firt, you have to run the file "GUIentrena.fig" along with "GUIentrena.m" in the same file. You can open images (or record them with a Gige camera), binarize and extract some texture's characteristics. In order to make the training procedure simpler, each image must be of only one type (Gordal or Nevadillo). 

More information included in the powerpoint file (only in Spanish).
